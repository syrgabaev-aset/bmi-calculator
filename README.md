1. Introduction

This assignment is focused on learning the basics of backend web development using Node.js and Express.
The goal of the task is to build a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that works through HTTP requests and demonstrates routing, request handling, and server-side logic.

2. Project Description

The BMI Calculator allows a user to enter their weight and height using a web form.
After submitting the form, the server calculates the BMI value and displays the result along with a health category such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

3. Technologies Used

Node.js

Express.js

HTML

CSS

npm

4. Server Implementation

The backend server is built using Node.js and Express.
Routing is implemented to handle user requests and calculate BMI values on the server side.

5. User Interface

The application provides a simple and clean HTML form where users can input their weight and height.
CSS is used to center the form and improve the visual appearance.

6. BMI Calculation Result

After submitting the form, the server calculates the BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight / (height × height)

The result page displays the calculated BMI value and the corresponding category.

7. Error Handling

If a user tries to access a page that does not exist, the server returns a 404 error page.

8. Conclusion

This assignment helped in understanding the basic concepts of backend development, including server setup, routing, form handling, and request-response cycles.
The project follows the examples and structure provided during lectures and practice sessions.
